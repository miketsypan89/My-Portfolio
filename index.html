        <div class="about-me-text">
            <p>My actual name is Mikhail, but I like to go by Mike. I was born in the Ukraine into a family of 9 kids.
                Our family immigrated to the United States when I was 11 years old. Originally, we settled in the
                beautiful mountains of Western North Carolina. </p>
            <p>I am passionate about God and His ever-growing Kingdom here on Earth. I went to a Bible College in
                Jacksonville, Florida in 2011, and a few years later I've decided to permanently move here. </p>
            <p>It was here in Jacksonville where I met my wife. We have been happily married since August of 2014. </p>
            <p>I'm very blessed with three beautiful kids, whom I absolutely adore (two girls and a boy; ages 7, 5 and
                3) </p>
            <p>Currently I work in logistics, but have sparked an interest in coding and decided to build my skill set
                by attending a bootcamp at UCF.</p>

    <!-- Starting here, I had to be very careful and creative using display:flex to make sure all of my small work placeholders would wrap around nicely. Later in the CSS, I had to add media Query in them and add properties to let them stack back into 1 column for better readability. -->
