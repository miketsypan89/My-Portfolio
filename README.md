# My-Portfolio
This was a week 2 Class Challenge from the UCF Bootcamp.

The objective here was to create a responsive webpage that links to other pages, as well as scrolls down to certain sections of the page when buttons are clicked.
Biggest challenge was and a take-away was learning the use of display:flex as well as the Media Query. Both of which helped me gain knowelage that will be useful in the Future.
Here are 2 examples how how the page will look on 2 different screens.
Best for Viewing are:
- 1920px wide screen (standart desktop)
- 820px wide screen (portrait mode of an iPan Air)

Here are 2 examples of how they will appear:
